      <description>I am a software engineer who loves learning about and solving challenging problems.
Previously, I was a software engineer at Meta Reality Labs Research where I worked on the future of Augmented Reality and Contextualized AI by developing Project Aria. I then spearheaded the data engineering department at Inflexion Games on a live-service survival multiplayer game called Nightingale.
I graduated from Cornell University with a Masters in 2020. My interests are in data and engineering, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and virtual/augmented reality.</description>
