      <description>I am a software engineer who loves learning about and solving challenging problems. I am currently working at Inflexion Games on a live-service survival multiplayer game called Nightingale!
Previously, I was a software engineer at Meta Reality Labs Research where I worked on the future of Augmented Reality and Contextualized AI by developing Project Aria.
I graduated from Cornell University with a Masters in 2020. My interests are in data design and engineering, virtual/augmented reality, artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, evolutionary algorithms, and game design.</description>
